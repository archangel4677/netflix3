# netflix3
So this is my first project in Javascript where I aimed to recreate netflix homepage with an improved search bar (I personally feel ;) )and netflix carousel ui.
I used js to identify clicks on the handles at right and left and to further move the carousle accordingly.I also used js to fetch the names of movies from my card to display underneath the trailer.
The watch trailer button was linke dot each trailer embedded in an iframe with movie name being displayed below
Finally the site is deployed using Render
